		<h1>Email Client Support Scoreboard</h1>
		<p>
			This page ranks email clients based on their support among the <b>{{ site.features.size | default: "many" }}</b> HTML and CSS features listed on Can I email.
		</p>
		<p>
			(Because every test is done manually, some features might not have been tested on every email client.)
