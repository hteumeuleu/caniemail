Today marks the sixth anniversary since [I officially unveiled Can I email](/news/2019-09-09-introducing-caniemail/). I still fondly remember the cheers I got from the crowd as [I revealed the site](https://vimeo.com/362137699#t=42m16s) after my talk at Smashing Conf.

Six years after, Can I email is still up and running. From 50 HTML and CSS features tested across 25 emails clients at launch, we now have more than 300 features tested across 41 email clients.

In the past year, the site received over 130¬†000 visitors and generated more than 170¬†000 page views. (According to Matomo.)

The site now lives a pretty steady life and everything‚Äôs going well. Right?  
Everything‚Äôs going well, right?

Well, sure. But as the content grows and grows, it‚Äôs taking more and more time to add new features, new email clients and make sure the existing content is up to date. And while I know I can count on the email geeks community to report major changes in the big email clients and update the site in a timely manner, I must also be honest and state that some data regarding more obscure features in less popular email clients might not be exactly up to date.

The problem is that, since day one, everything here is done manually, from writing tests to testing to reporting and updating the site. And it‚Äôs about time we change things a bit and start automatizing things. (And just for saying it loud: no, we can not and will not use any big lying ‚Äú[Homework Machine](https://www.hteumeuleu.fr/the-homework-machine/)‚Äù.) But just like I had this feeling we could have better tools to learn about HTML and CSS support in emails six years ago, I feel like we can have better tools to test HTML emails right now.

To help us with this, we‚Äôre excited to welcome our very first sponsor: [Resend](https://go.resend.com/caniemail). While I was exploring how to allocate more time to update the site, through ads (yikes) or crowdfunding, Resend came to me to offer to sponsor us for a year. This sponsorship will help us devote proper time from our usual agency work to help evolve Can I email and build the next generation of email testing tools. And I can‚Äôt wait to get started and keep you updated!
