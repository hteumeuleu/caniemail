Over the past few months, fellow email geek Hussein Al Hammad (@husseinalhammad) has been submitting a lot of great contributions to the site. I finally got to merge his last <abbr title="Pull Request">PR</abbr>. So a proper announcement for all those new data is well overdue. You can now find the following:

* [`rgb()`](/features/css-rgb/) and [`rgba()`](/features/css-rgba/)
* [`caption-side`](/features/css-caption-side/)
* [`clip-path`](/features/css-clip-path/)
* [`align-items`](/features/css-align-items/) and [`justify-content`](/features/css-justify-content/)
* [`@media (prefers-reduce-motion)`](/features/css-at-media-prefers-reduced-motion/)
* [`font-weight`](/features/css-font-weight/)
* [`text-indent`](/features/css-text-indent/)
* [`<address>`](/features/html-address/)
* [`<object>`](/features/html-object/)
* [AVIF image format](/features/image-avif/)
* And an update to [`border-radius`](/features/css-border-radius/) to include tests for the `/` syntax

Huge thanks to Hussein for all these contributions!
