Last march, I wrote [a proposal for Can I email](http://127.0.0.1:4000/news/2019-03-15-caniemail-a-proposal/), a website similar to [caniuse.com](https://www.caniuse.com) dedicated to support in email clients.

Today, barely six months after, I am really happy and pleased to announce that with the help of my colleagues and members of the email geeks community, we're officially launching [caniemail.com](https://www.caniemail.com).

So far, we have more than 50 HTML and CSS features tested across 25 emails clients. And we've got a lot more coming up in the following weeks and months.

We're also delighted to present [the Email Client Support Scoreboard](/scoreboard/). For the first time in history, we provide an objective ranking of email clients based on their support for HTML and CSS features. We hope this will set new standards for the industry and encourage the less good students to improve.

This website is made by and for the email geeks community. All the data presented is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/hteumeuleu/caniemail/tree/master/_features) for anyone to update, complement or contest. Check out [our contribution guide](https://github.com/hteumeuleu/caniemail/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and feel free to ask any question that you have.

We hope you will enjoy the site and contribute in any way you can.
