We're super excited to roll out a new functionality to Can I email: Estimated Support. Each feature page now includes a little widget at the top showing the estimated support of said feature across email clients. [See an example on the `display:flex` page.](/features/css-display-flex/)

[![Screenshot of the estimated support functionality](/assets/images/posts/2020-02-13-estimated-support.png)](/features/css-display-flex/)

The supported data is provided by [EmailClientMarketShare.com](https://www.emailclientmarketshare.com), a service ran by [Litmus](https://www.litmus.com).

While we think this is a valuable functionality to help make technical choices, it is important to keep in mind how email tracking works and how accurate (or how inaccurate) this data can be. Make sure to [read the _Estimated Support_ about page](/support/) to get all the details worth noting.

Let us know what you think about this [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/caniemail/)! And if you see something wrong or have any questions, you can [report an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/hteumeuleu/caniemail/issues).
